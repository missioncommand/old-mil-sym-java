MIL-STD-2525
-----------
The [MIL-STD-2525] standard defines how to visualize military symbology.  This project provides support for the entire MIL-STD-2525B Change II plus USAS 13-14 and MIL-STD-2525C.  

Project Structure
------------
mil-sym-java is a project that contains three distinct components:
- Core: The low level libraries for generating complex line and polygon based symbols such as tactical graphics.  This component is not intended to be used directly.  This project outputs a set of jar files.

- Renderer: This is the component that can be used in Java applications to generate the entire MIL-STD-2525 symbol for both icons based symbols and geometric symbols such as tactical graphics.  Renderer relies on the jar files generated by Core.

- Service: This component uses the Core and Renderer jar files and creates a REST web service interface that can be deployed to a Java servlet container such as:

  - Apache Tomcat
  - JBOSS
  - WebLogic
  - Jetty

Tech
-----------

mil-sym-java project uses a handful of open source projects to work properly:

* [Maven] - Open source Apache build manager for Java projects
* [jQuery] - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library 

Build
--------------
This project builds with Maven.  The output of the core and renderer project is a set of JAR files and the service project outputs a WAR file as described under project structure.  A top level parent pom file builds all the projects in the correct order with a single command. 

Open a command prompt to the root folder of the repository on your local machine and enter:
```sh
