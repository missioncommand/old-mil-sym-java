About
-----------
mil-sym-java is a well worn set of java libraries that have been used in US Army Mission Command software for years.  In November 2013 Mission Command was given the approval to release and maintain these libraries as public open source.

MIL-STD-2525
-----------
The [MIL-STD-2525] standard defines how to visualize military symbology.  This project provides support for the entire MIL-STD-2525B Change II plus USAS 13-14 and MIL-STD-2525C.  

Project Structure
------------
mil-sym-java is a project that contains three distinct components:
- Core: The low level libraries for generating complex line and polygon based symbols such as tactical graphics.  This component is not intended to be used directly.  This project outputs a set of jar files.

- Renderer: This is the component that can be used in Java applications to generate the entire MIL-STD-2525 symbol for both icons based symbols and geometric symbols such as tactical graphics.  Renderer relies on the jar files generated by Core.

- Service: This component uses the Core and Renderer jar files and creates a REST web service interface that can be deployed to a Java servlet container such as:

  - Apache Tomcat
  - JBOSS
  - WebLogic
  - Jetty

Tech
-----------

mil-sym-java project uses a handful of open source projects to work properly:

* [Maven] - Open source Apache build manager for Java projects
* [jQuery] - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library 

Build
--------------
This project builds with Maven.  The output of the core and renderer project is a set of JAR files and the service project outputs a WAR file as described under project structure.  A top level parent pom file builds all the projects in the correct order with a single command. 

Open a command prompt to the root folder of the repository on your local machine and enter:
```sh
mvn clean install
